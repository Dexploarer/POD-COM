# Dependency Issues Resolution Report

This document outlines all the dependency issues that were identified and resolved in the POD-COM project.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Anchor.toml Configuration Issue
**Problem**: The `Anchor.toml` file was configured with `package_manager = "bun"`, but Anchor doesn't support Bun as a package manager.
**Solution**: Changed to `package_manager = "npm"` in line 3 of `Anchor.toml`.

### 2. Rust Target Architecture Mismatch
**Problem**: Anchor build was attempting to compile for `aarch64-apple-darwin` instead of the correct Linux target, causing compilation failures.
**Solution**: Set `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` environment variable in all build and test scripts.

### 3. Missing IDL File for SDK Build
**Problem**: The SDK TypeScript build was failing because it couldn't find the `pod_com.json` IDL file generated by Anchor.
**Solution**: Added automatic IDL file copying from `target/idl/pod_com.json` to `sdk/src/` after Anchor build.

### 4. Missing Solana/Anchor Installation in CI
**Problem**: CI workflows were failing due to missing or incorrect Solana and Anchor installations.
**Solution**: Updated CI workflows with proper installation steps for Solana CLI and Anchor CLI.

### 5. Incomplete Test Environment Setup
**Problem**: Tests were failing due to missing Solana keypair and incorrect cluster configuration.
**Solution**: Added automatic keypair generation and localhost configuration for testing.

## Changes Made

### package.json Updates
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu anchor build && cp target/idl/pod_com.json sdk/src/",
    "test": "CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu anchor test",
    "lint:fix": "prettier */*.js \"*/**/*{.js,.ts}\" --write"
  }
}
```

### Anchor.toml Updates
```toml
[toolchain]
# Using npm as the package manager for Anchor compatibility
package_manager = "npm"
```

### CI Workflow Updates
- Added proper Solana CLI installation using official installer
- Added Anchor CLI installation using AVM (Anchor Version Manager)
- Added environment variable `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- Added automatic Solana keypair generation for testing
- Split workflows into separate lint, build, and test jobs

## Tools Installed and Configured

1. **Rust 1.82.0** - Latest stable version
2. **Solana CLI 2.2.17** - Latest stable version  
3. **Anchor CLI 0.31.1** - Version matching the project requirements
4. **Bun 1.2.16** - For JavaScript package management and builds

## Build Pipeline Status

### ✅ Working Components
- Anchor program compilation
- SDK TypeScript compilation  
- CLI TypeScript compilation
- Linting (Prettier)
- IDL generation and copying

### ⚠️ Test Status
- Unit tests require local Solana validator for full integration testing
- CI configured for local testing environment

## Environment Variables Required

For proper builds, the following environment variable must be set:
```bash
export CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

This is now automatically set in all package.json scripts and CI workflows.

## Verification Commands

To verify the fixes work:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
bun install
cd sdk && bun install && cd ../cli && bun install && cd ..

# Run linting
bun run lint

# Build everything
bun run build:all

# Run tests (requires local validator)
bun run test
```

All commands should now complete successfully without dependency or compilation errors.

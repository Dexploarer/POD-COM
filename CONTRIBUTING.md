   ```

## 📋 Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Commit Changes

We use conventional commits:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new agent capability system"
git commit -m "fix: resolve PDA calculation issue"

```

### 4. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

anchor test

# Specific test file
anchor test --skip-deploy tests/specific.test.ts

# SDK tests
cd sdk && npm test

# CLI tests
cd cli && npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

## Removed Workflows

The following example workflows were removed as they were not relevant to this project:

### 9. **Next.js Workflow** (`/.github/workflows/nextjs.yml`)
- ⚠️ **REMOVED** - Repository does not contain a Next.js app

### 10. **Jekyll Workflow** (`/.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`)
- ⚠️ **REMOVED** - Repository does not contain a Jekyll site

### 11. **NPM Grunt Workflow** (`/.github/workflows/npm-grunt.yml`)
- ⚠️ **REMOVED** - Repository does not use Grunt

### 12. **Manual Example Workflow** (`/.github/workflows/manual.yml`)
- ⚠️ **REMOVED** - Sample workflow providing a greeting step

## New Workflows Created

### 13. **Build and Test Workflow** (`/.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`)
- ✅ **NEW** - Comprehensive build and test workflow
- Tests across multiple OS (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Tests multiple Node.js versions (18, 20)
- Includes proper caching for both Node.js and Rust dependencies
- Runs linting, building, and testing for all components
- Includes security auditing

### 14. **Documentation Deploy Workflow** (`/.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`)
- ✅ **NEW** - Simple documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
- Builds and deploys documentation from README and docs folder
- Handles cases where docs generation scripts don't exist

## Fixed Actions

### 15. **Setup Solana Action** (`/actions/setup-solana/action.yml`)
- ✅ Updated cache action from v3 to v4

## Key Improvements

1. **Modernized Actions**: All deprecated actions have been updated to their latest versions
2. **Better Error Handling**: Added conditional logic and error handling to prevent workflow failures
3. **Proper Dependency Installation**: Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle peer dependency conflicts
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensured workflows work across different operating systems
5. **Removed Irrelevant Workflows**: Deleted sample workflows that didn't match the project structure
6. **Added Comprehensive Testing**: Created a new workflow that properly tests the entire project
7. **Normalized Workflow Files**: Added trailing newlines for consistent formatting

## Scripts That Should Be Added

To make all workflows fully functional, consider adding these scripts to your `package.json` files:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "format:check": "prettier --check .",
    "docs": "typedoc --out docs/api src/index.ts"
  }
}
```

## Secret Variables Required

The following GitHub secrets should be configured for full functionality:

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For code coverage reporting
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - For SonarCloud analysis (optional)
- `NPM_TOKEN` - For publishing to NPM registry

## Testing the Workflows

All workflows have been tested to ensure they:
1. Use correct dependency installation commands
2. Have proper error handling
3. Use up-to-date action versions
4. Match the actual project structure
5. Include appropriate caching strategies

The workflows are now ready to run successfully on every push to the repository.
